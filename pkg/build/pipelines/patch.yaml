    description: |
      The number of path components to strip while extracting.
    default: 1

  fuzz:
    description: |
      Sets the maximum fuzz factor. This option only applies to context diffs, and causes patch to ignore up to that many lines in looking for places to install a hunk.
    default: 2

  patches:
    description: |
      A list of patches to apply, as a whitespace delimited string.

  series:
    description: |
      A quilt-style patch series file to apply.

pipeline:

      series='${{inputs.series}}'
