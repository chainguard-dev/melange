  # When ownership of files created inside and outside of the runner container do not
  # match, if mode is restrictive on files like 0700 on the Melange workspace, if the git-checkout
  # pipeline changes ownership on them, being that it runs inside the runner container, subsequent
  # filesystem operations run outside of the runner fail because of missing permissions.
  # This happens specifically with tar --extract without preserving ownership of existing files,
  # like '.', which in case of the default input and standard usage of the pipeline, is the
  # workspace directory.
  # This results in subsequent operations like xattrs restore to fail as they are run outside of
  # the runner container.
  #
  # Bubblewrap runner:
  #   Since the user namespace is unshared and that the runner uid is mapped to the
  #   uid of the user who runs Melange, ownership always match.
  #   - Melange run by root -> runner user: root.
  #     Owner of files created outside of the runner:
  #       - host: root
  #       - runner: root
  #     Owner of files creted inside the runner:
  #       - host: root
  #       - runner: root
  #   - Melange run by non-root -> runner user: build (1000 mapped to non-root).
  #     Owner of files created outside of the runner:
  #       - host: non-root
  #       - runner: build (1000 -> host's non-root)
  #     Owner of files creted inside the runner:
  #       - host: non-root
  #       - runner: build (1000 -> host's non-root)
  #
  # Docker runner:
  #   Since the user namespace is shared, ownership between files created inside and
  #   outside the runner, match only when the user who runs Melange is root.
  #   - Melange run by root -> runner user: root.
  #     Owner of files created outside of the runner:
  #       - host: root
  #       - runner: root
  #     Owner of files creted inside the runner:
  #       - host: root
  #       - runner: root
